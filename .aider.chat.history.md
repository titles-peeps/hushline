Issue #: 4
Title: Update the default brand color CSS

Task:
- Write minimal pytest tests that reproduce the issue or define the requested feature.
- Implement the smallest change to pass tests.
- Preserve public APIs and security posture (CSP, TOTP, Tor, crypto).
- Use repository conventions (pytest, Black/isort). No new services/env vars.

Output rules:
- Return unified diffs only (no prose).
- If touching auth/CSP/crypto, include tests hardening those paths.

Context:
Problem:
The CSS custom property `--color-brand` is currently defined as:
`--color-brand: oklch(48.55% 0.222 304.47);`

Expected Outcome:
Update this property to:
`--color-brand: #000;`

File Path:
`assets/scss/style.scss`
(Line: near top-level `:root` selector, defined once)
