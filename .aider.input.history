+Issue #: 4
+Title: Update the default brand color CSS
+
+Task:
+- Write minimal pytest tests that reproduce the issue or define the requested feature.
+- Implement the smallest change to pass tests.
+- Preserve public APIs and security posture (CSP, TOTP, Tor, crypto).
+- Use repository conventions (pytest, Black/isort). No new services/env vars.
+
+Output rules:
+- Return unified diffs only (no prose).
+- If touching auth/CSP/crypto, include tests hardening those paths.
+
+Context:
+Problem:
+The CSS custom property `--color-brand` is currently defined as:
+`--color-brand: oklch(48.55% 0.222 304.47);`
+
+Expected Outcome:
+Update this property to:
+`--color-brand: #000;`
+
+File Path:
+`assets/scss/style.scss`
+(Line: near top-level `:root` selector, defined once)
